# üèóÔ∏è Microservice Developer Roadmap (Beginner ‚Üí Advanced)

---

## Stage 0 ‚Äî Mindset & Fundamentals (Groundwork)

### What to learn
- **Distributed systems basics:** CAP theorem, consistency vs availability, latency, partial failure.
- **Microservice principles:** bounded contexts, single responsibility, loose coupling, deployment independence.
- **Twelve-Factor App & Twelve-Factor Microservices** ideas.

### Hands-on tasks
- Read short summaries / cheat sheets on **CAP** and **idempotency**.
- Take one Django app you built and **separate concerns into modules** ‚Äî think about bounded contexts.

### Deliverable
- A short document (README) describing the bounded contexts for a simple domain  
  *(e.g., e-commerce: users, catalog, orders, payments)*.

---

## Stage 1 ‚Äî API Design & Contracts

### What to learn
- RESTful API design, HTTP semantics, status codes, pagination, filtering, HATEOAS (optional).
- OpenAPI / Swagger for **contract-first APIs**.
- API versioning and backward compatibility.

### Hands-on tasks
- Implement a clean **REST API** with DRF: serializers, viewsets, router, pagination, throttling.
- Publish an OpenAPI spec (**drf-spectacular** or **drf-yasg**).

### Deliverable
- A DRF microservice skeleton with **OpenAPI spec**, README and example **curl calls**.

### Tech notes for Django devs
- Use **djangorestframework**, **drf-spectacular / drf-yasg**,  
  **django-rest-framework-simplejwt** (JWT) for auth.

---

## Stage 2 ‚Äî Per-Service Data & Data Design

### What to learn
- One database per service, schema ownership, avoiding cross-service joins.
- Migration strategies and schema evolution.
- Transaction boundaries, eventual consistency, idempotency.

### Hands-on tasks
- Create independent **Postgres instances** for two small services (e.g., users & orders).
- Implement **eventual consistency** using events (see next stage).

### Deliverable
- Two services, each with its own **DB** and migration scripts;  
  README explains how **data flows** between them.

---

## Stage 3 ‚Äî Asynchronous Communication & Event Design

### What to learn
- Message brokers: **RabbitMQ, Kafka**; pub/sub vs queues.
- Event-driven architecture: events, domain events, event schemas, schema registry.
- Patterns: **Sagas** (orchestration vs choreography), idempotency, retry/backoff, dead-letter queues.

### Hands-on tasks
- Add a **message broker** (RabbitMQ or Kafka) to your local stack.
- Implement an event: when **OrderPlaced** occurs in Order service, publish event;  
  **User** or **Notification** service consumes it.

### Deliverable
- Multi-service demo with **published/consumed events**,  
  consumer **idempotency** and a **dead-letter queue** for failed messages.

### Suggested libs
- **celery** for tasks (with RabbitMQ/Redis)
- **confluent-kafka-python** or **aiokafka** for Kafka.

---

## Stage 4 ‚Äî Containers & Local Multi-Service Dev

### What to learn
- Dockerfile best practices, multi-stage builds, small images.
- **docker-compose** for local orchestration (Postgres, RabbitMQ, multiple services).

### Hands-on tasks
- Dockerize each service; create a **docker-compose.yml** that starts the system (DBs, broker, services).

### Deliverable
- Single `docker-compose up` starts your multi-service app, with **health endpoints documented**.

---

## Stage 5 ‚Äî Orchestration: Kubernetes Basics

### What to learn
- Kubernetes objects: **Pod, Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, Ingress**.
- Liveness/readiness probes; resource requests/limits.
- Namespaces, rolling updates, services & DNS.

### Hands-on tasks
- Deploy your dockerized services to a local k8s (**minikube**, **kind**).
- Add readiness/liveness probes, a single **Ingress** for the gateway.

### Deliverable
- k8s **manifests/Helm chart** and README showing how to deploy locally to kind or minikube.

---

## Stage 6 ‚Äî API Gateway, Service Discovery & Networking

### What to learn
- API Gateway patterns (routing, auth, rate limiting).
- Service discovery: k8s DNS, or **Consul** for non-k8s.

### Hands-on tasks
- Add an **API Gateway** (Traefik / Kong / Ambassador) in front of services;
- Implement **rate limiting** and **authentication passthrough**.

### Deliverable
- Gateway config that routes to services and protects endpoints with simple auth.

---

## Stage 7 ‚Äî CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code

### What to learn
- CI: automated tests, lint, build, container push.
- CD: deploy to k8s via **kubectl** or **Helm** in pipeline.
- IaC: **Terraform** for cloud infra; Helm charts for app.

### Hands-on tasks
- Build a pipeline (**GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**) that runs tests,
  builds images, pushes to a registry, and deploys to k8s.

### Deliverable
- A working pipeline file + docs explaining the stages.

---

## Stage 8 ‚Äî Observability: Logs, Metrics, Tracing, Alerting

### What to learn
- Centralized logging (**EFK/ELK**) with structured JSON logs.
- Metrics + monitoring: **Prometheus + Grafana**; instrument code with metrics.
- Distributed tracing: **OpenTelemetry + Jaeger**.

### Hands-on tasks
- Emit structured logs and add a metrics endpoint for Prometheus.
- Add distributed trace across a request that calls multiple services.

### Deliverable
- Dashboards/trace screenshots and instructions to reproduce.

### Libraries
- **opentelemetry-python**, **prometheus_client**, **structlog/python-json-logger**.

---

## Stage 9 ‚Äî Security & Identity

### What to learn
- Auth patterns: **OAuth2 / OIDC**, JWT lifecycle, refresh tokens.
- Service-to-service auth: **mTLS**, mutual TLS, or short-lived tokens.
- Secrets management: **Vault**, AWS Secrets Manager.

### Hands-on tasks
- Add centralized auth (**Keycloak** or **Auth0**) and integrate with your services.
- Store DB credentials in a secret manager or k8s secrets.

### Deliverable
- Secure auth flow documented and demoed; secret rotation plan.

### DRF tip
- **django-oauth-toolkit** or integrate with external **OIDC** provider.

---

## Stage 10 ‚Äî Resiliency, Performance & Testing

### What to learn
- Circuit breakers, bulkheads, retries, backpressure.
- Load testing (**locust**, **k6**) and profiling.
- Testing microservices: unit, integration, contract tests
  (consumer-driven contracts, e.g., **Pact**).

### Hands-on tasks
- Implement retry + circuit breaker (client-side) for external calls.
- Write consumer-driven contract tests between two services.
- Run a load test and optimize bottleneck (DB indexes, caching).

### Deliverable
- Test reports, contract tests, load test results and optimizations implemented.

---

## Stage 11 ‚Äî Advanced Topics

### What to learn
- **Event sourcing & CQRS** (when appropriate).
- Streaming & analytics (**Kafka streams**).
- **Service mesh** (Istio / Linkerd) for traffic control, mTLS and observability.

### Hands-on tasks
- Prototype a **Saga orchestration** for complex distributed transaction
  (order ‚Üí payment ‚Üí inventory).
- Try a **service mesh** on your k8s cluster and observe traffic/mTLS.

### Deliverable
- Prototype code + writeup of tradeoffs and what you learned.

  Docker-compose + k8s + gateway + CI.  
  **Deliver:** README, architecture diagram, OpenAPI specs, CI pipeline.

- **Event-driven order flow:** OrderService publishes `OrderPlaced` ‚Üí Inventory & Payment consume.  
  Implement retries, DLQ.

- **Auth & API gateway:** Keycloak + Gateway that enforces scopes/roles.

- **Observability demo:** End-to-end traces and dashboards for a cross-service request.

- **Resiliency demo:** Simulate downstream failure and show circuit breaker + graceful degradation.

---

## ‚úÖ Microservice Checklist (for every service)

- README + OpenAPI spec
- Dockerfile (multi-stage) + health endpoints (`/healthz`, `/ready`)
- Liveness/readiness probes + graceful shutdown handling
- Structured JSON logs with **correlation ID**
- Metrics endpoint for **Prometheus**
- Retry & **idempotency** on operations that may run twice
- Integration & unit tests + CI step
- Secrets via Vault/k8s secrets + config via ConfigMap / env vars
- Versioning and changelog for public APIs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them
- **Splitting too early** ‚Äî design bounded contexts first.
- **Sharing the same DB across services** ‚Äî causes coupling.
- **No observability** ‚Äî then you can‚Äôt debug production failures.
- **Ignoring data consistency** ‚Äî plan for eventual consistency and sagas.
- **Tight coupling via synchronous calls** ‚Äî prefer async events for decoupling.
